# Obfuscation-and-Deobfuscation-Approaches-Tools-and-Datasets

This thesis proposes an investigation into code obfuscation and deobfuscation.

The student is expected to produce a guide to the tools used for obfuscation and deobfuscation for a given language (e.g., JavaScript), public datasets, and the main methodologies employed in this field.

Deobfuscation, in particular, will be analyzed in detail, examining traditional methodologies and potential novel methods (e.g., those based on neural networks).

The student is expected to deliver an overview of the state-of-the-art in code obfuscation and deobfuscation, as well as datasets that can be used to develop novel techniques in this field.


deobfuscate is to remove obfuscation from computer code, making it accessible to humans. In software development, obfuscation purposefully conceals or distorts parts of the code to make the program difficult to detect, tamper with, or reverse engineer.
